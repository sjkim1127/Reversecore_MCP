# Test Sample Binaries

This directory contains test binary files for integration testing.

## Sample Files

- `hello_world.elf` - Simple ELF binary (to be generated)
- `hello_world.exe` - Simple PE binary (to be generated)
- `simple_binary.bin` - Generic binary file (to be generated)

## Generation

Test binaries are generated during test setup or CI/CD pipeline.
For local development, use system binaries like `/bin/ls` or `/bin/cat`.
